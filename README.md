# 🚀 100 Days of RTL Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of RTL Challenge** repository! 🎉

In this project, I will be coding various digital designs using **Verilog** and **RTL** design techniques as part of a 100-day challenge to improve my hardware description language (HDL) skills.

## 📅 Progress

- **Day 1**: *Basic Gates using Behavioral Design*
- **Day 2**: *Basic Gates using Structural Design*
- **Day 3**: *Basic Gates using Gate Level Design*
- **Day 4**: *MOS Inverter Design & Testbench*  
- **Day 5**: *Random Boolean Expression (ABC + A'C' + D)* 
- **Day 6**: *Half Adder & Full Adder*  
- **Day 7**: *Half Subtractor & Full Subtractor*
- **Day 8**: *4-bit Parallel Adder with Control Input*
- **Day 10**: *Ripple Carry Adder using 4 Full Adders*
- **Day 11**: *4-bit Binary Multiplier with Adder-Based Partial Product Summation*
- **Day 12**: *Half Adder, Full Adder, Half Subtractor, Full Subtractor using Nand Gate*
- *... (Tasks will be added as I progress)*

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- **Vivado 2024.1** 🛠️
  - The designs will be synthesized and simulated using the latest version of Xilinx Vivado (2024.1).
