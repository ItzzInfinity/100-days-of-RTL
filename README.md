# 🚀 100 Days of RTL Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of RTL Challenge** repository! 🎉

In this project, I will be coding various digital designs using **Verilog** and **RTL** design techniques as part of a 100-day challenge to improve my hardware description language (HDL) skills.

## 📅 Progress

- **Day 1**: Basic Gates using Behavioral Design
- **Day 2**: Basic Gates using Structural Design
- *... (Tasks will be added as I progress)*

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- **Vivado 2024.1** 🛠️
  - The designs will be synthesized and simulated using the latest version of Xilinx Vivado (2024.1).

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `day_001/`: Contains the design and testbench for Day 1.
- `day_002/`: Contains the design and testbench for Day 2.
- *... (New directories will be added for each day)*
