ðŸ”‹ Day 4 of #100DaysOfRTL: MOS Inverter in Verilog ðŸ”‹

Excited to share my latest milestone! Today, I implemented a MOS Inverter using PMOS and NMOS transistors in Verilog. Along with that, I created a testbench to simulate the inverter's behavior.

This challenge is helping me dive deeper into digital design concepts, and Iâ€™m loving the process of learning through coding and simulations. ðŸ’»ðŸ”§

Onward to more complex designs! ðŸš€
