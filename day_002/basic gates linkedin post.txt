ðŸš€ Day 2 of #100DaysOfRTL: Structural Design of Basic Gates ðŸš€

Today, I built basic logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) using the structural design style in Verilog. It's been a great experience getting hands-on with more in-depth digital design techniques. Each day is sharpening my understanding of how RTL design can be structured at a fundamental level.

Excited to continue exploring more complex designs in the days to come! ðŸ’»
